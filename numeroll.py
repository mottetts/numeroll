#CPU algorithm here
#use a function to return best strategic slot
#sample rules:
#   the closer the number is to 9, the farther left it should go
#   the closer it is to 1, the farther right it should go
#   based on the desired position, sort through the cpu_number from
#       left to right or from right to left
#   additionally, cpu needs to take into account how many turns are
#       remaining--this will affect the probability of the cpu's choosing
#       a position all the way left or right
#
#the simplest rule would be:
#if rando == 9 and cpu_number[0] == 0:
#   cpu_number[0] = rando
